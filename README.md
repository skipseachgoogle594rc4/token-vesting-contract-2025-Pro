## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that touches on a common point of confusion in the crypto space.

Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of how a **token-vesting-contract** actually integrates with major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, clarifying the reality versus the common misconception.

### The Short Answer: Direct Integration Doesn't Happen

A **token-vesting-contract** is a smart contract deployed on a blockchain (like Ethereum, BSC, or Solana). Its primary function is to hold and release tokens to predefined addresses according to a set schedule (e.g., a 4-year vesting period with a 1-year cliff).

**Major cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken are centralized platforms.** They do not, and for security and operational reasons, **cannot directly interact with or "integrate" with an on-chain vesting contract in an automated way for trading.**

The two systems operate in different realms:
*   **Vesting Contract:** On-chain, decentralized, and trustless.
*   **Centralized Exchange (CEX):** Off-chain, centralized, and custodial.
